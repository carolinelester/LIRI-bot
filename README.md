LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This app makes calls to the Spotify API, BandsInTown API, and OMDB API for search results.

When running this app in your command line, you may use the following to find your desired data: 'spotify-this-song', 'concert-this', 'movie-this', and 'do-what-it-says'.
